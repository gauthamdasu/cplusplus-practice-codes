# A simple memory game implemented in c++. 
This is a project given in the book Objeted Oriented Programming with C++ by Balaguruswamy.

The idea of the project is to get familiar and understand the concepts of programming in c++.

The readme is further updated accordingly as and when changes are made to the code base.
